Readme: Analysis of School District Data

This analysis uses data from a school district, including information on schools' budgets, sizes, and performance on math and reading tests. The data was analyzed to determine which factors are most closely related to academic achievement, as well as to identify trends and differences between different schools.

Reading Scores
Some schools have consistently higher scores across all grade levels, such as Cabrera High School, which has an average reading score above 83 for every grade. Other schools, like Bailey High School, have lower average reading scores below 78 for every grade.

Spending per Student Summary
Looking at the data, schools that spend less than $585 per student have the highest average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing compared to other spending ranges. As spending per student increases, the average math and reading scores decrease, and the percentage of students passing math and reading also decrease. However, it's interesting to note that schools in the $645-680 range have a slightly higher passing rate for reading compared to schools in the $630-645 range.

Scores by School Size
Schools with larger student populations tend to have lower average scores and passing rates than smaller schools. Small and medium schools have higher average math and reading scores and higher percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall compared to large schools.

School Type
Charter schools generally have higher average scores and passing rates than district schools, which is reflected in this data set as well.

Top Performing Schools
The top five highest performing schools in terms of the overall passing rate, which is the percentage of students who passed both math and reading tests, are all charter schools. Cabrera High School has the highest overall passing rate of 95.59%, followed closely by Thomas High School at 95.29%.

In summary, this analysis shows that smaller schools, charter schools, and schools with lower per-student budgets tend to have higher average scores and passing rates. However, other factors, such as teaching quality and student engagement, may also be important in determining academic success.
